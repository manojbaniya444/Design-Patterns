### Prototype Pattern
The prototype pattern creates new objects by copying existing objects rather than creating them from scratch. This is useful when object creation is expensive or complex.

- create a new object by cloning the existing object
- avoid expensive initialization and reuse configured objects
- polymorphic construction: creates objects without knowing thier exact class
