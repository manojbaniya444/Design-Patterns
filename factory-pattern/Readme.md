# Factory Method

Factory method is a `creational design pattern` that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

The Factory Method pattern suggests that we replace the direct object construction calls (using the new operator) with calls to a special factory method.
